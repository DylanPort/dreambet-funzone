I'll help you write out the full code for `src/pages/TokenDetail.tsx`, replacing all placeholders with the actual code. However, I notice that the original file is quite long (over 1000 lines) and contains many complex components and logic. To ensure accuracy, could you please share the current content of your `src/pages/TokenDetail.tsx` file? This will help me merge the new changes correctly while preserving all the existing functionality.

The main changes we need to make are:
1. Adding the `convertPXBToBet` function
2. Adding the `handlePXBBetAction` function
3. Modifying the bets display section to show both regular and PXB bets
4. Updating the layout and styling

With your current file contents, I can provide the exact code you need to copy and paste, ensuring all the existing functionality remains intact while adding the new features.
